# Oerating System Concepts with Android

This repository contains my solutions for a course in operating system concepts with Android environment. The course not only focuses on the characteristics of major operating systems, but also ensures students to be equipped with the knowledge of using efficient algorithms for the functionalities of operating systems and able to perform system programming.


#### Course Outline : 
This course aims to introduce the concepts, design principles and architectures of modern operating systems. The topics will focus on the management of computing resources, including process, memory, storage and file system. Various algorithms for resource scheduling, synchronization, caching and failure recovery will be discussed. Android operating system will be used as the platform for system programming.
